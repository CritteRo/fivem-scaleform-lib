# fivem-scaleform-lib
## A library of GTA 5 scaleforms for FiveM. All scaleforms can be activated using events.
 All events are client-side only. If you want to use them from server-side too, you will need to register them in `cl_main.lua`.
 
 As I find more usable scaleforms, I will keep this resource updated. If you know some cool scaleforms, feel free to make a PR.

## Current list of scaleforms included:

You can find all the relevant information, and how to use every scaleform on the [Wiki](https://github.com/CritteRo/fivem-scaleform-lib/wiki)

## Issues and Pull Requests:

Creating issues and pull requests are always appreciated! I started this resource because I really like working with scaleforms, and I want future devs to be able to access these scaleforms without any inconvenience.
